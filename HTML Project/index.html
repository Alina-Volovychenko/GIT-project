<h2>Places worth visiting</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Cinque Terre</b>. This is a world-famous beauty spot and stunning portion of the Italian Riviera! I was completely won over by how these five brightly colored medieval villages cling jaggedly and to the inhospitable coastal rocks.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast</b>. I swear this was one of the most romantic places I have ever visited! I thought it was impossibly picturesque, with a rugged, glistening coastline where pastel-colored cliffside villages and fine historic buildings clung dramatically to the rocks.<p/></li>
<li><p><b>Florence</b>. I thought the capital city of the Tuscany was a really fascinating place! It was seriously stunning, with extraordinary Renaissance architecture, a famous domed cathedral, and a treasure trove of art all set along the scenic banks of the Arno River.<p/></li>
<li><p><b>Lake Como</b>. This was a stunning glacial lake and a popular upscale resort! I thought it was breathtaking, with deep azure waters framed by lush green mountains, elegant historic villas with landscaped gardens, and charming old villages. I loved its refined, upscale vibe!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Rome</b>. Many say that the capital of Italy is the best open-air museum and I have to agree! I found it was a busy but extraordinarily beautiful place with a breathtaking blend of ancient ruins, the world-famous Colosseum and Roman Forum, magnificent Renaissance architecture and charming cobbled streets lined with Baroque fountains and pretty piazzas.</p></li>
